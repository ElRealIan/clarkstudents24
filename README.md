# IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR TEACHER/TA

# DO NOT PUBLISH THIS FILE!


# Week 2 - Setup
1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account. Only have one person do this (Teacher OR TA)
2. Add this file to the `.gitignore` file.
3. Have the students pull this repository onto their AWS instance by using the GitHub Desktop application. These details are in the `github.md` file in the `week2` folder.
4. If needed, have them run the root.py file to grant access to the databases needed for the course.
   * This will create a user and database for the students to use.
   * On line 9, you may need to have the students change the password to their own password if on their local machine.

# Every Week
The TA/Teacher should update the .gitignore file to open up the files needed for each week.
* When you reach week 7, note that there are files for each version of the assignment. Copy and rename the file from the version you want to use to `week#hw.sql`. This will hide what version you are using from the students. Apply this method to the rest of the weeks for the rest of the course.
* Have the students pull the repository to get access to the new files for the week.
* The week 13 homework files can be used as the week12 template files for the final project queries.
